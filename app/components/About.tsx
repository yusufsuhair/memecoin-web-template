            MEME is tired of watching everyone play hot potato with the endless derivative coins.
            The Inu's have had their day. It's time for the most recognizable meme in the world to take
            his reign as king of the internet.
          </p>
          <p>
            MEME is here to make memecoins great again. Launched stealth with no presale, zero taxes,
            LP burnt and contract renounced, $MEME is a coin for the people, forever. Fueled by pure
            memetic power, let $MEME show you the way.
